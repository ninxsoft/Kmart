OVERVIEW: Kick-Ass Mac Admin Reporting Tool

Generate kick-ass Jamf Pro reports.

USAGE: kmart [--json <json>] [--plist <plist>] [--yaml <yaml>]

OPTIONS:
  -j, --json <json>       JSON configuration file.
  -p, --plist <plist>     Property List configuration file.
  -y, --yaml <yaml>       YAML configuration file.
  --version               Show the version.

```

## Configuration

- See [Sample Configs](Sample%20Configs) for all configuration options.

  **Note**: Use the following command to encode your credentials in the configuration file:

  `printf 'username:password' | iconv --to-code ISO-8859-1 | base64`

- For Slack integration, read [Basic app setup](https://api.slack.com/authentication/basics) to create a Slack app with a Bot token.

  **Note:** The Bot token will require the `chat:write` and `files:write` [permission scopes](https://api.slack.com/scopes).

## Privileges

**Kmart** requires the following **user privileges** in order to report correctly.

**Recommendations:**

- Create a separate Jamf Pro User Account
- Do not just add these permissions to an existing account
- If you are not reporting on everything, only enable the privileges that are required
